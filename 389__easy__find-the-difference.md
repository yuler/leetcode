# Find the Difference

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:

    s = "abcd"
    t = "abcde"

    Output:
    e

    Explanation:
    'e' is the letter that was added.

```JavaScript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {character}
 */
var findTheDifference = function(s, t) {
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    const char = s[i]
    const index = t.indexOf(char)
    if (index === -1) {
      return char
    }
    t = t.slice(0, index) + t.slice(index + 1)
  }
  return t
};
```
