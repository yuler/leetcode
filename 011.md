# Container With Most Water

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

Example:

    Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
    Output: 49

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxArea = function(height) {
  let maxarea = 0
  let i = 0
  let r = height.length - 1
  while (i < r) {
    maxarea = Math.max(maxarea, Math.min(height[i], height[r]) * (r - i))
    if (height[i] < height[r]) {
      i ++
    } else {
      r --
    }
  }
  return maxarea
}
```
