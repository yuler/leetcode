# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

Example 1:

    Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

Example 2:

    Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Note:

  All of the nodes' values will be unique.
  p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.

```JavaScript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {TreeNode} p
 * @param {TreeNode} q
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var lowestCommonAncestor = function(root, p, q) {
  const parentVal = root.val
  const pVal = p.val  
  const qVal = q.val

  if (pVal > parentVal && qVal > parentVal) {
    return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
  } else if (pVal < parentVal && qVal < parentVal) {
    return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
  } else {
    return root
  }
};
