# Reverse Nodes in k-Group

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

Example:

    Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5
    For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5
    For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5


Note:

Only constant extra memory is allowed.
You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.


```JavaScript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var reverseKGroup = function(head, k) {
  if (!head || !head.next || k === 1) return head

  const dummy = new ListNode(0)
  dummy.next = head

  let begin = dummy

  for (let i = 1; head; i++) {
    if (i % k !== 0) {
      head = head.next
    } else {
      begin = reverseMid(begin, head.next)
      head = begin.next
    }
  }

  return dummy.next
};

const reverseMid = (begin, end) => {
  let prev = begin
  let cur = begin.next
  let next

  let tail = begin.next
  while (cur !== end) {
    next = cur.next
    cur.next = prev
    prev = cur
    cur = next
  }

  begin.next = prev
  tail.next = end
  return tail
}
