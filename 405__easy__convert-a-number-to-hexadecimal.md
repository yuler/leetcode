# Convert a Number to Hexadecimal

Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.

Note:

  1. All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
  2. The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
  3. The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
  4. You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.

Example 1:

    Input:
    26

    Output:
    "1a"

Example 2:

    Input:
    -1

    Output:
    "ffffffff"


```JavaScript
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {string}
 */
var toHex = function(num) {
  if (num === 0) return '0'

  const arr = ['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','a','b','c','d','e','f']

  let result = ''
  while (num != 0) {
    result = arr[(num & 15)] + result
    num >>>= 4
  }
  return result
};
```
